  <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
  <h3>randallreedjr.com</h3>
  <p>This site! As an exercise in minimalism, I created the site from scratch in a text editor. As new features were added, the site grew in complexity, and now uses Gulp to pre-compile the Sass to CSS and Rake to deploy using the aws cli tool. It is hosted on AWS in an S3 bucket.</p>
